            <img src="Image/Story1.jpg" alt="A tall, handsome man stands outside the cheap exterior of an apartment. He grasps the doorknob, eager to satiate his hunger after a long day." style="width:100%">
            <figcaption>First I arrive at my home after a long day of work and or play. Either way, I am tuckered out and in need of something to raise my spirits. </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure>
            <img src="Image/Story2.jpg" alt="An arm reaches toward a refrigerator door, which is decorated with colorful magnets and a poster of the 2017 film 'Lady Bird' directed by Greta Gerwig." style="width:100%">
            <figcaption>In my search for a moral-boosting treat, I head to my fridge to see what I have available. My first instinct is to look through the freezer for some of my frozen snacks.
</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure>
            <img src="Image/Story3.jpg" alt="A tall handsome man stands with a hand on his chin, pondering the contents of his freezer. Waffle fries are in the freezer door." style="width:100%">
            <figcaption>There are so many choices laid out in front of me so I take a moment to ponder as the cold air rushes out of the freezer slowly raising my electric bill. This moment of seemingly deep thought is but a facade as I know what I desire.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure>
            <img src="Image/Story4.jpg" alt="A tall handsome man holds a freezer-burnt corndog. He gazes upon the corndog, seemingly weighing the pros and cons of eating it." style="width:100%">
            <figcaption>Then my eyes meet with my heart's desire, a classic corn dog. She is my old reliable friend who has never done me wrong. My day has just improved drastically. </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure>
            <img src="Image/Story5.jpg" alt="The freezer-burnt corndog rests on a bed of aluminum foil in an air-fryer. The tall, handsome man's reflection bounces off the air-fryer." style="width:100%">
            <figcaption>Her only flaw is that she can be a bit icy and cold at times so I pop her in the air fryer on a boat of tinfoil to warm her up. I set the time to eight minutes and prepare the table for my snack.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure>
            <img src="Image/Story6.jpg" alt="The tall, handsome man sits atop his counter beside the air-fryer, eagerly waiting for the corndog to finish cooking at 375 degrees fahrenheit." style="width:100%">
            <figcaption>Perfection takes time so I wait the entire eight minutes while the sweet aroma of the bread surrounding the delicate hot dog emanates throughout the room. This is a moment of practiced patience and good things come to those who wait. </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure>
            <img src="Image/Story7.jpg" alt="The tall, handsome man sits at his dinner table, wielding a fork and knife. The corndog rests on a small porcelain plate, next to a bottle of French's Classic Yellow Mustard." style="width:100%">
            <figcaption>She’s ready and so am I so I place the corn dog on a plate and grab some utensils because I am not a savage. I then run into another predicament, she’s in the buff and needs to be dressed before we have our moment. </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure>
            <img src="Story8.jpg" alt="The man sits back with his hands on his stomach, visibly satisfied. Half of the corndog, remains on the small porcelain plate." style="width:100%">
            <figcaption>I drizzle the mustard across the corn dog in a zigzag pattern and immediately take a bite before the phone has a chance to capture the entire beauty of this fine cuisine. At this point, dopamine has rushed to my brain informing me that I have made a wise decision and the cycle will continue tomorrow when I prepare my next corn dog. </figcaption>
