      <h1> Top 7 Characters in a Haunted House You Wish Would Touch You </h1>
      <p>It’s common knowledge that in a haunted house guests are not allowed to touch haunted house workers and vice versa. 
        This rule helps protect workers and guests alike but some rules should be broken especially when you run into these famous characters.
      </p>

      <h2>7. The Clown</h2>

      <p>
        Starting off our list is the scary clown but he has a secret that got him on this list. He has a rigorous nighttime routine which includes taking off 
        all his makeup and body paint and most importantly, moisturizing. This clown does not joke around when it comes to drinking water and applying lotion. 
        He may have a dry sense of humor but there’s nothing else dry about this freak.

      <h2>6. Pinhead</h2>

<p>
  This may come as a shock but Pinhead actually has a gentle side. Most people would think that a man covered in sharp nails and needles would be untouchable but he actually has a secret passion. 
  Pinhead is certified in acupuncture which many people find extremely relaxing.
  If you are okay with reused needles Pinhead is one of the greats of the acupuncture world and he loves practicing his art form.

<p>
  We all know this guy from our favorite haunted attractions. He always appears right at the moment when you are sure there was no way they could fit a slime guy into this haunted hayride.
  Surprise is his guarantee and you might be surprised by how pleasant his goo is to the touch. 
  Dermatologists everywhere recommend just a small amount of slime guy’s slime every day for glowing radiant skin.

      <h2>4. Normal Nurse</h2>

<p>
Coming in at number four is an average-looking bloody nurse. A staple of the haunted house community but for some reason, guests wouldn’t mind getting vaccinated by her cold undead hands. 
You wouldn’t want the mad doctor laying a finger on you but when it comes to the nurse the normal rules of a haunted house are out the window. According to some guests, “She purdy”.

      <h2>3. Werewolf</h2>
 <img src="Werewolf.JPG" alt="A grainy image of a werewolf covered in hair, baring its teeth.">
<p>
Turns out this ruthless canine is secretly a good boy. Many would be surprised to find out the werewolf is actually just barking at you and chasing you on all fours nipping 
at your ankles because he wants some scratches behind the ears. This misunderstood mutt has extremely soft fur but never gets to show it off because everyone runs away.

      <h2>2. Cordu-Roy</h2>
 <img src="Cordu-Roy.JPG" alt="A model wearing a full body corduroy outfit.">
<p>
This bone-chilling skeleton of a man has a scary surprise that can’t be experienced with just sight. He is dressed head to toe in the most unpleasant material known to man 
corduroy and he wants you to graze up on it for the full experience. He is breaking the norms of the industry with his artistry and micro-tearing up your fingertips with every touch.

      <h2>1. The Fidgetor</h2>
 <img src="TheFidgetor.JPG" alt="An image of a rainbow children's pop-it fidgeting tool with cartoon eyes.">
<p>
You came to a haunted house to escape this atrocity but it followed you. It knows that the scariest thing in your everyday life is a child who is not being stimulated enough. 
The worst part is that you know you want to touch it. You’ve had sick fantasies of giving this pop-it a try but you stop yourself because you're an adult. 
But no one would know if you maybe just popped one bubble but once you pop you can’t stop.
Soon enough it's 3 a.m., your family is worried, you don’t remember the last 5 hours you spent with the Fidgeter, and when you look around… it's gone.
